    "# Multi-Plant Tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-plant workflows, images with multiple plants are processed and result in individual pictures for each plant, allowing a secondary workflow\n",
    "(see [VIS tutorial](vis_tutorial.ipynb) for example) to be used.\n",
    "The challenge of multi-plant processing is that a single plant can be composed of several contours, therefore contours need to be sorted and clustered together in some way.\n",
    "There are several functions that help with multi-plant image processing. First, the current clustering functions work by asking the user to provide an approximation of the number of desired\n",
    "'rows' and 'columns' that they would like to split the image into. There does not need to be a plant in each spot, but the grid is used as an approximate region to cluster contours within.\n",
    "The [rotation](https://plantcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rotate2/) and [shift](https://plantcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shift/) functions allow the image to be moved to optimize accurate clustering. Major assumptions that are made are that plants grow but\n",
    "that the imaging position does not change drastically.\n",
    "Also, the clustering functions will not work properly once plants start overlapping, since contours would also start overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a multi-plant workflow over a single VIS image there are two required inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Image:** Images can be processed regardless of what type of VIS camera was used (high-throughput platform, digital camera, cell phone camera).\n",
    "Image processing will work with adjustments if images are well lit and free of background that is similar in color to plant material.  \n",
    "2.  **Output directory:** If debug mode is set to 'print' output images from each step are produced."
